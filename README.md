# Kotlin Pathfinding
A simple GUI for visualizing pathfinding algorithms such as A*, Dijkstra's, and Best-First search algorithms. Simply compile and run the Kotlin file "Screen.kt" in the "frontend" package to start the program.

# General Usage
If you want a quick and dirty grid to see the algorithms you can click on "Grid Manipulations" menu and select the "Generate Random Grid" button. 

If you want more granular control over the obstacles, start, and end nodes then you can also do so by selecting the "Items" menu inside of "Grid Manipulations". Simply select what element you want to place (ie block, start, or end) and click the location on the grid you want to place it in. 

After you have a start and end node defined then select an algorithm from the "Algorithms" drop down menu and watch the visualization!

# Dependencies
This is not a pure Kotlin implementation, it is meant to run on the JVM with Java dependencies such as Swing.
